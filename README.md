# clearhead-graphd

Standalone graph/query tool and graph-runtime library for ClearHead. It owns
Oxigraph, RDF materialization, SPARQL execution, query registration, shape
validation, and JSON-LD serialization. `clearhead-core` remains the
graph-neutral domain/workspace substrate.

The first implementation is deliberately one-shot rather than a resident
daemon. It discovers ClearHead configuration through core and can be installed
and used without the `clearhead` CLI.

## Query interface

Run a built-in index view:

```sh
clearhead-graphd --workspace /path/to/project query index unscheduled
```

Inspect and run registered queries:

```sh
clearhead-graphd --workspace /path/to/project query list
clearhead-graphd --workspace /path/to/project query show agenda
clearhead-graphd --workspace /path/to/project query named high-priority
```

Run ad-hoc SPARQL or a raw `WHERE` clause:

```sh
clearhead-graphd --workspace /path/to/project query raw \
  'SELECT ?name WHERE { ?action rdfs:label ?name }'
clearhead-graphd --workspace /path/to/project query raw \
  --where '?action rdfs:label ?name'
```

Use `query <command> --help` for parameters such as `--status`, `--target`, and
`--format`.

### Query discovery

Queries are resolved from these layers, with the more local definition taking
precedence:

- graphd's built-in registry
- the user's ClearHead config directory under `queries/`
- `<workspace>/.clearhead/queries/`

Index queries live in an `index/` subdirectory. graphd loads the primary
workspace plus configured `additional_workspaces` into separate named graphs.

### Output

Output is destination-aware. A terminal defaults to a human rendering. A pipe
uses the query family's machine projection: index views emit NDJSON, while
unrestricted `SELECT` queries emit JSON row arrays. Index views validate their
addressable-row contract before any projection. Explicit `--format table`,
`json`, `ndjson`, and `jsonld` override detection where supported.

The semantic rules for index output are documented in
[`docs/query_contract.md`](docs/query_contract.md). Exact JSON-LD fields are in
[`docs/jsonld_export_contract.md`](docs/jsonld_export_contract.md).

The `clearhead` CLI forwards its query commands to this same public command
interface with inherited stdio. Set `CLEARHEAD_GRAPHD` to select a particular
graphd executable.

## Domain JSON to JSON-LD export

`export-jsonld` is the remaining stdin protocol. It reads a JSON-encoded
`DomainModel` and writes canonical JSON-LD:

```sh
clearhead-graphd export-jsonld < domain-model.json
```

Warnings and errors go to stderr. A failed command exits non-zero, and callers
must not consume stdout.

## Development

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path clearhead-graphd/Cargo.toml
```
